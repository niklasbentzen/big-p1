# Project 1: Distributed Hashing
T-764-DATA â€“ Spring 2025

This project includes a simple simulation model for distributed hashing. It is made to experiment with different distribution methods. The code is structured as following:

- `./src/model/` contains the DHT model
- `./src/simulation/Simulation` contains the simulation used to run experiments with
